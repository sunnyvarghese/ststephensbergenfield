              <h1>Martha Mariyam Vanitha Samajam (MMVS)</h1>
              <p>Let us praise the name of God almighty for all the blessings he has showered upon us throughout the past year. It is with great appreciation and delight I present the first annual report of our parish, St. Stephen's, Midland Park, NJ, for the year 2012. Thanks to God almighty for all His blessings and the leadership of Vicar Rev. Fr. Babu K Mathew, and our member's selfless dedication, contributions and service. In this annual report, you will get a glance of our activities, accomplishments, and challenges. May God continue to shower His blessings to achieve our dreams and aspirations.</p>
              <p>Samajam Secretary for 2012 was Sally Abraham; Mrs. Elizabeth Mathew acted as the Joint Secretary and Mrs. Leena Varghese as the Young Women's Secretary. We conducted 7 meetings in the year. After the Holy Qurbana, Fr. Babu K. Mathew presided over all our meetings, opening with a prayer and bible readings. All members read small portions of each chapter and made it a point to follow the gospels religiously. After the songs, bible reading & prayers, Vicar of the church lead discussions, bible classes, speeches regarding how powerful the Martha Mariam Samajam can grow, and how the samajam can plan programmes etc. This is followed by the secretary reading the minutes documented from the previous conducted meetings. The reports are read and passed. On an average 20 members participate in these monthly meetings, which last for an hour.</p>
              <p>Martha Mariam Vanitha Samajam activities in 2012 included Bible Study, Retreats, One Day Conferences, Quiz competitions, etc., to improve upon the spiritual life of our members and their families. Added to this, as a part of our Charity programs, we extended financial help for the 'Baselious Balabhavan' organization fund in Puthupaadi, 'Swanthvanam' organization run by Very Rev. Fr. Edayanal Cor-episcopa. Furthermore, we provided housing assistance to the needy and homeless visited the sick as well as the people in distress. Programs like World Day of Prayer, observation of three day Nineveh lent, great lent and Observation of the Feast of Assumption of St. Mary are also being followed religiously. We were also graced by the presence of some prominent church figures such as priests, seminarians and well-known members of our community who led us in fellowship and prayer. These include Fr. Basil Thomas, and Deacons Shinto David, Tenny Thomas, and lastly Asha Thomas who led few spiritual sessions for our members.</p>
              <p>It is very much encouraging to all our Members that our Samajam President Fr. Babu K Mathew is actively involved in all our programmes which helps boost the morale of our members. Achen's leadership, guidance and concern for all our activities at unit and diocese level encourage the members to actively participate in the various programmes in large numbers.</p>
              <p>I conclude this report by expressing my sincere submission and devotion to the Head of our diocese, His Grace Zachariah Mar Nicholovos. We also submit in prayers for the intercession of St. Mary, the guiding spirit of our Samajam, St. Stephen the driving force of our parish and all the Saints and Martyrs.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,<br />
                Saly Abraham<br />
